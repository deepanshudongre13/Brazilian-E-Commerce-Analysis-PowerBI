# 🇧🇷 Brazilian E-Commerce Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Olist E-Commerce dataset**, covering over **96,000 orders** from 2016 to 2018. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights using Power BI, focusing on sales performance, regional distribution, and customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Key Business Insights
- **Revenue Intelligence:** Analyzed a total of **$13.59M in revenue**, identifying São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) as the top-performing regions.
- **Logistics Bottleneck:** Uncovered a critical correlation—an average delivery delay of **11.88 days** directly resulted in a significant drop in customer review scores.
- **Product Performance:** Identified `Health_Beauty` and `Watches_Gifts` as the most profitable categories.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Skills
- **ETL Process:** Used **Power Query** for data cleaning, handling missing values, and data type normalization.
- **Data Modeling:** Implemented a **Star Schema** to establish efficient relationships between 9 relational tables.
- **DAX:** Developed advanced measures for dynamic KPIs (Total Sales, Avg Delivery Time, YoY Growth).
- **UI/UX:** Created an interactive 2-page dashboard with **Page Navigation, Sync Slicers, and Conditional Formatting**.
